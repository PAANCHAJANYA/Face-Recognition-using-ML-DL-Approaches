Face Recognition in Dark Environments
Pose Invariance
Illumination Invariance
Potential for higher recognition accuracy because the features such as normal and curvature on faces are better described rather than a 2D image.
Data acquisition
Face point cloud reconstruction
Facial recognition using 3D point cloud data
ROI Confinement through Head Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Multi view Point Cloud Registration using ICP
Outlier Detection using DBSCAN
